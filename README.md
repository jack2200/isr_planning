This repository contains a set of pkgs that combined together form a
task planning framework that serves as a bridge with robotics.

It was developed by Oscar Lima (olima@isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) while
being @ Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences in Germany and
currently @ Instituto Superior Tecnico, Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR)
as part of his PhD thesis in the scope of the FCT HARODE project.

This planning framework has been tested in two real robots:
- KUKA youBot (pick and place scenario)
- Mbot robot (at home service robotics scenario)

Is flexible, modular and its components can be easily reusable totally or partially
based upon the user needs.
