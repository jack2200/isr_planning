mercury_planner
===============

Mercury planner is a task planner from International Planning Competition 2014 (IPC) created by 

Michael Katz and JÃ¶rg Hoffmann from Saarland University, Germany. The source of the planner is

provided under the following url:

        https://helios.hud.ac.uk/scommv/IPC-14/repo_planners/Mercury-fixed.zip
        
This package downloads that file, extracts only the sequential satisfactory folder (seq-sat-mercury)

and compiles it.

The dependencies of the planner are:

          sudo apt-get install bison flex gawk g++-multilib pypy
          
NOTE: Keep in mind that the script repository.debs at the root of mas_third_party_software installs

those dependencies along with all the mas_third_party_software dependencies for the rest of the packages.
